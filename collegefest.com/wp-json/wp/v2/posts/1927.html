Though it has not been the easiest of times, people are coming together to help each other. It can be as easy as saying \u201chi\u201d from across the street. It is hard to see facial expressions through masks so vocalize your kindness. Spread positivity to your community by making signs to put in your windows so people see them walking by OR grab some chalk and draw all-around your neighborhood! \u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is one thing we can all take away from this time it should be how important it is to keep each other safe and healthy.

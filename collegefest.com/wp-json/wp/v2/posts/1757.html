Get out of your routine and explore the city. Here are a few ideas below to help get you started on your planning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=../../../../_https_/paddleboston.com/about/about-paddle-boston/index.html target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rent Canoes<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visit Paddle Boston to rent a canoe, kayak or paddle board to spend the afternoon exploring the Boston scenery and beautiful weather this summer. Avoid the busy lines and crowds of tourists as you paddle down the Charles River.\u00a0You will paddle past many colleges in Boston, the Esplanade, Prudential Building, and so on. Explore the city from the water while experiencing the city rush. Step back and relax on your own time frame on the river. This is a great group activity to do with friends, family and even your dog! If you are interested in purchasing a season pass, the student rate for all the rentals is only $119.00 compared to the regular rate of $219.00. There are a lot of opportunities for students to have fun in Boston and you save some money when doing so.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1771\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1771\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1771 size-full\" src=../../../../_https_/collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle.png/index.html alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"548\" srcset=\"https:\/\/collegefest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/paddle.png 1024w, https:\/\/collegefest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/paddle-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/collegefest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/paddle-768x411.png 768w, https:\/\/collegefest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/paddle-750x400.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1771\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Paddle Boston<\/p><\/div>\n<p><a href=../../../../_https_/www.thefreedomtrail.org/index.html target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Walk the Freedom Trail<\/strong> <\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Freedom Trail is one of the largest attractions of all the historic landmarks in Boston. Being local, we tend to forget that people come from far and wide to walk this trail and take photographs of all the famous sites along the trail. You can walk along the trail with a map or join a tour group from Boston Common all the way to the Bunker Hill Monument. This trail will bring you back to your Elementary history lesson and to be thankful for this historic landmark being so accessible to us all.<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1786\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1786\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1786 size-large\" src=../../../../_https_/collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-1024x768.jpg/index.html alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/collegefest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Freedom-Trail-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/collegefest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Freedom-Trail-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/collegefest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Freedom-Trail-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/collegefest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Freedom-Trail-1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1786\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Boston by Foot<\/p><\/div>\n<p><a href=../../../../_https_/www.neaq.org/index.html target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Visit the New England Aquarium<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Experience the world under water of Boston Harbor at the New England Aquarium.

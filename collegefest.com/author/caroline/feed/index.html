										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt about it, Summer 2020 is a lot different than the past. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t still have fun! Summer 2020 is definitely not cancelled! So, if you’re still itching to get outside and get out of the house check out these ideas of things to do in/around Boston this summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Go to a Drive-in Movie</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may be an old fashioned way to see a movie, but retro is in! While many regular movie theaters are closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, drive-in movies are fully open for the season. A drive-in is a perfect way to get your movie fix, while still maintaining social distancing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England has plenty of theaters to choose from:</span></p>
<p><b>Massachusetts: </b><a href="http://www.leicesterdrivein.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leicester Triple Drive-In Theatre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.wellfleetcinemas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellfleet Cinemas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></p>
<p><b>New Hampshire: </b><a href="http://www.northfielddrivein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northfield Drive-In Theatre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://milforddrivein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milford Drive-In Theater</span></a></p>
<p><b>Rhode Island (near MA border):</b> <a href="https://www.yourneighborhoodtheatre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rustic Tri-View Drive-in</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Make sure to check with your local movie theater. Some theaters are putting on make-shift drive-ins in their parking lots. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Visit an Outdoor Museum/Garden</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because some museums are closed, doesn’t mean they all are. There are still so many things to learn and places to explore! Check out one of the many open air museums in/around the city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in history then </span><a href="http://osv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturbridge Village</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is perfect for you! There you can go back in time and experience what it was like in the 19th centuries in Massachusetts. (Make sure to get your tickets in advance).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people more interested in taking in some beautiful scenery and art, </span><a href="https://heritagemuseumsandgardens.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heritage Gardens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://decordova.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deCordova sculpture park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are open for business. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1956" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1956" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1956 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carson-beach-e1595018144708.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="334" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carson-beach-e1595018144708.jpg 550w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carson-beach-e1595018144708-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1956" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by BostonPhotoSphere on flickr</p></div>
<p><b>Head to the Water</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s the beach, lake, or river, Boston has it all! Taking a trip to the water can be incredibly restorative, energizing, relaxing, and most importantly, fun!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some great beaches for swimming, relaxing, and amazing views directly in the city are Carson Beach in Southie and Orient Street Beach in East Boston (which has terrific views of the planes taking off and landing at the airport). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you’re looking for a bit of a beach escape you can easily take a short trip from the city to Marblehead, MA for the deeply gorgeous and refreshing, rocky beaches.  Or head to Falmouth, Cape Cod to take in the warmer and softer coastline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For something a bit more active, head down the Charles River where you can rent canoes, paddle boards, and kayaks to take on the river. Just make sure to watch out for the rowers while you’re out there! </span><a href="http://paddleboston.com/rentals/our-locations/boston-allston-brighton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paddle Boston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has everything you need for a fun afternoon/day on the water. They are currently requiring reservations, so make sure to book online or give them a call before you go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Visit a Park or Forest  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many gorgeous parks and forests throughout greater Boston that you can visit while still practicing social distancing. Whether you want to go on a hike, nature walk, mountain biking, or just sight see, there’s something for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a more scenic trip that takes you through the city, try the Freedom Trail, which showcases Boston’s historic past and some truly beautiful neighborhoods. The Boston Harbor and Castle Island loop is perfect for a scenic afternoon walk with a great view of the skyline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a bit more activity though check out Blue Hills Reservation just outside of the city. There are dozens of great trails for hiking, running, mountain biking, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**For a more detailed list of the best trails around the city, check out AllTrails.com. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Have a Socially Distant Picnic </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to eat out and see your friends and family, while still being socially distant, is to have a picnic! Grab your favorite food and drinks as takeout (or pack your own for a more budget friendly option), and a blanket, and call up your friends and family. Seeing them in person, even from 6 ft apart, is amazing. Trust us!</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1957" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1957" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1957 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/site-105-area-6.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/site-105-area-6.jpg 550w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/site-105-area-6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1957" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: LiseGa2015 via TripAdvisor</p></div>
<p><b>Camping </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many traditional vacations have been cancelled, it doesn’t mean you can’t still get away! There are plenty of campsites in Massachusetts and around the country that are open for business. You can spend your time swinging in hammocks, swimming, stargazing, and connecting with nature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative option: camp in your backyard. If you want the comfort of staying at home, but still want a new experience, pitch a tent in the backyard for a few nights, make a campfire, and look up at the stars. It can be just as fun!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Take a Road Trip </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a road trip is another classic vacation that can still be done this summer. There is so much of this country to see, so why not start now? Whether you’re interested in seeing the mountains, the beach, the forest, or a new city, there are countless road trips that you can take. The only limit is your imagination. </span></p>
<p>**Be sure to check and follow state and local guidelines regarding out of state visitors.</p>

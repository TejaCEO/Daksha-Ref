<div id="attachment_1739" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1739" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1739 size-medium" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/queen-300x197.png" alt="" width="300" height="197" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/queen-300x197.png 300w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/queen-768x504.png 768w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/queen-1024x672.png 1024w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/queen.png 1028w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1739" class="wp-caption-text">(Credit: Gary Miller/Getty Images)</p></div>
<p><strong>St.Peter&#8217;s Fiesta:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Fiesta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Peter’s Fiesta</a>, is a celebration of the city’s commercial fishing and faith, that has grown to become a city-wide party in Gloucester, MA. The events features parades, seine boat races, the blessing of the city’s commercial fishing fleet, a mid-way and the famous greasy pole contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Greasy Pole is an annual event in Gloucester MA that takes place at the Pavilion beach. This fishing port attracts the biggest crowd of the summer to watch walkers attempt to cross the greasy pole. The 40 foot wooden pole extends from a platform off Pavilion beach. The walkers end goal is the cross the pole without falling to get the red flag at the end of the pole. Winners, in addition to an inflated ego, gets carried through town, free drinks around Gloucester and fame to last a lifetime!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may ask what makes the pole so greasy? Good ole Crisco from bacon fat, fish guts and other fats local restaurants find to make the pole a greasy, slippery and challenging walk.</span></p>
<p>In general Fiesta is the biggest party weekend in Gloucester. It&#8217;s also easily accessible for summer students in Boston via the Rockport Commuter rail line, out of North Station.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested in watching this entertaining, free, and hilarious event? Head out to St. Peter’s Fiesta in Gloucester, MA on the weekend of June 28th.</span></p>

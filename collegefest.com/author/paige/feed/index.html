										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking for activities to do in Boston this summer? Get out of your routine and explore the city. Here are a few ideas below to help get you started on your planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://paddleboston.com/about/about-paddle-boston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rent Canoes</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit Paddle Boston to rent a canoe, kayak or paddle board to spend the afternoon exploring the Boston scenery and beautiful weather this summer. Avoid the busy lines and crowds of tourists as you paddle down the Charles River. You will paddle past many colleges in Boston, the Esplanade, Prudential Building, and so on. Explore the city from the water while experiencing the city rush. Step back and relax on your own time frame on the river. This is a great group activity to do with friends, family and even your dog! If you are interested in purchasing a season pass, the student rate for all the rentals is only $119.00 compared to the regular rate of $219.00. There are a lot of opportunities for students to have fun in Boston and you save some money when doing so.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1771" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1771" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1771 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle.png" alt="" width="1024" height="548" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle.png 1024w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle-300x161.png 300w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle-768x411.png 768w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle-750x400.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1771" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Paddle Boston</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.thefreedomtrail.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Walk the Freedom Trail</strong> </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Freedom Trail is one of the largest attractions of all the historic landmarks in Boston. Being local, we tend to forget that people come from far and wide to walk this trail and take photographs of all the famous sites along the trail. You can walk along the trail with a map or join a tour group from Boston Common all the way to the Bunker Hill Monument. This trail will bring you back to your Elementary history lesson and to be thankful for this historic landmark being so accessible to us all.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1786" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1786" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1786 size-large" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1786" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Boston by Foot</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.neaq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Visit the New England Aquarium</strong></a></p>
<p>Experience the world under water of Boston Harbor at the New England Aquarium. With over 70 exhibits, there is always the chance to meet the animals and watch them in action. Visiting the aquarium is a great experience whether you have a passion for animals or you want to grow a deeper connection and understanding about a particular species. With a college student I.D there is a discount off one full-priced admission ticket. Check with your student activities department at your school to find out if your school offers additional discounts for their students.</p>
<div id="attachment_1775" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1775" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1775 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NEAquarium.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="430" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NEAquarium.jpg 680w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NEAquarium-300x190.jpg 300w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NEAquarium-94x60.jpg 94w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1775" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Duro Terra</p></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bostonducktours.com/Tickets/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrYmC9ZWF4wIVhiaGCh2AXAsQEAAYAyAAEgJhyfD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duck Tours</a> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing more authentic and classic to do in Boston than a Duck tour. Ride in the renovated World War II vehicle to visit a couple of the historical landmarks and then end your tour in the water for a ride along the Charles River. Throughout the ride there is narration led by the conductor. You&#8217;ll learn about all about Boston, ranging from the historical importance of Faneuil Hall to the height of the Prudential Tower and everything in between. Tickets are sold in advance for this great group activity. This is an exciting and memorable experience like no other.</span></p>

CrossFit stands out compared to a typical fitness facility as they incorporate gymnastics, kettlebells and various forms of weight lifting that will work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high intensity cardio sessions which develops a well-rounded strong athlete. What better way to blow off some steam, and meet new people than getting stronger and lifting at CrossFitSouthie!

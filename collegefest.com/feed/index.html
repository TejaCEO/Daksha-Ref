										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt about it, Summer 2020 is a lot different than the past. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t still have fun! Summer 2020 is definitely not cancelled! So, if you’re still itching to get outside and get out of the house check out these ideas of things to do in/around Boston this summer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Go to a Drive-in Movie</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may be an old fashioned way to see a movie, but retro is in! While many regular movie theaters are closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, drive-in movies are fully open for the season. A drive-in is a perfect way to get your movie fix, while still maintaining social distancing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England has plenty of theaters to choose from:</span></p>
<p><b>Massachusetts: </b><a href="http://www.leicesterdrivein.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leicester Triple Drive-In Theatre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.wellfleetcinemas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellfleet Cinemas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></p>
<p><b>New Hampshire: </b><a href="http://www.northfielddrivein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northfield Drive-In Theatre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://milforddrivein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milford Drive-In Theater</span></a></p>
<p><b>Rhode Island (near MA border):</b> <a href="https://www.yourneighborhoodtheatre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rustic Tri-View Drive-in</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Make sure to check with your local movie theater. Some theaters are putting on make-shift drive-ins in their parking lots. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Visit an Outdoor Museum/Garden</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because some museums are closed, doesn’t mean they all are. There are still so many things to learn and places to explore! Check out one of the many open air museums in/around the city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in history then </span><a href="http://osv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturbridge Village</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is perfect for you! There you can go back in time and experience what it was like in the 19th centuries in Massachusetts. (Make sure to get your tickets in advance).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people more interested in taking in some beautiful scenery and art, </span><a href="https://heritagemuseumsandgardens.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heritage Gardens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://decordova.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deCordova sculpture park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are open for business. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_1956" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1956" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1956 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carson-beach-e1595018144708.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="334" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carson-beach-e1595018144708.jpg 550w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/carson-beach-e1595018144708-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1956" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by BostonPhotoSphere on flickr</p></div>
<p><b>Head to the Water</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s the beach, lake, or river, Boston has it all! Taking a trip to the water can be incredibly restorative, energizing, relaxing, and most importantly, fun!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some great beaches for swimming, relaxing, and amazing views directly in the city are Carson Beach in Southie and Orient Street Beach in East Boston (which has terrific views of the planes taking off and landing at the airport). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you’re looking for a bit of a beach escape you can easily take a short trip from the city to Marblehead, MA for the deeply gorgeous and refreshing, rocky beaches.  Or head to Falmouth, Cape Cod to take in the warmer and softer coastline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For something a bit more active, head down the Charles River where you can rent canoes, paddle boards, and kayaks to take on the river. Just make sure to watch out for the rowers while you’re out there! </span><a href="http://paddleboston.com/rentals/our-locations/boston-allston-brighton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paddle Boston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has everything you need for a fun afternoon/day on the water. They are currently requiring reservations, so make sure to book online or give them a call before you go.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Visit a Park or Forest  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many gorgeous parks and forests throughout greater Boston that you can visit while still practicing social distancing. Whether you want to go on a hike, nature walk, mountain biking, or just sight see, there’s something for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a more scenic trip that takes you through the city, try the Freedom Trail, which showcases Boston’s historic past and some truly beautiful neighborhoods. The Boston Harbor and Castle Island loop is perfect for a scenic afternoon walk with a great view of the skyline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a bit more activity though check out Blue Hills Reservation just outside of the city. There are dozens of great trails for hiking, running, mountain biking, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**For a more detailed list of the best trails around the city, check out AllTrails.com. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Have a Socially Distant Picnic </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to eat out and see your friends and family, while still being socially distant, is to have a picnic! Grab your favorite food and drinks as takeout (or pack your own for a more budget friendly option), and a blanket, and call up your friends and family. Seeing them in person, even from 6 ft apart, is amazing. Trust us!</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1957" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1957" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1957 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/site-105-area-6.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/site-105-area-6.jpg 550w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/site-105-area-6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1957" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: LiseGa2015 via TripAdvisor</p></div>
<p><b>Camping </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many traditional vacations have been cancelled, it doesn’t mean you can’t still get away! There are plenty of campsites in Massachusetts and around the country that are open for business. You can spend your time swinging in hammocks, swimming, stargazing, and connecting with nature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative option: camp in your backyard. If you want the comfort of staying at home, but still want a new experience, pitch a tent in the backyard for a few nights, make a campfire, and look up at the stars. It can be just as fun!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Take a Road Trip </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a road trip is another classic vacation that can still be done this summer. There is so much of this country to see, so why not start now? Whether you’re interested in seeing the mountains, the beach, the forest, or a new city, there are countless road trips that you can take. The only limit is your imagination. </span></p>
<p>**Be sure to check and follow state and local guidelines regarding out of state visitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have Fun and Stay Safe! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people &#8211; myself included &#8211; had different plans when it comes to Summer 2020. Contrary to popular belief though, Summer 2020 is not canceled. There are so many fun activities you can do to get active, have fun with loved ones, and stay safe!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_1930" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1930" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1930 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/one-pot-garden.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/one-pot-garden.jpg 650w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/one-pot-garden-300x200.jpg 300w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/one-pot-garden-570x380.jpg 570w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1930" class="wp-caption-text">(Source: homedit.com)</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Start an herb garden! </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may be my new personal favorite. You can use your homegrown </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ict29d8GeXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">herbs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when cooking or making refreshing summer drinks! Whether you live in a home with a yard or in an apartment in the city this is something everyone can do! If you have tin cans or mason jars lying around you can head to your local plant shop to get the soil and seeds. You can get really creative with this and paint your cans and customize your labels for the herbs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Play Outside! </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go back to your childhood and bring back all your favorite outdoor games. You can have a water balloon fight, slip and slide, grab some water guns, and have a water gun fight! Head to the beach and build sandcastles. If you have friends, family, or a dog around you can grab a ball or Frisbee and play catch! There are so many activities you can do safely that are fun and able to be done at a distance with your friends and family! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Socially Distant Picnic! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put together a basket or bag with your blanket, </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/729737939/travel-cutlery-set-zero-waste-utensil?gpla=1&amp;gao=1&amp;&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=shopping_us_back_to_school_All_Products&amp;utm_custom1=2aab59ed-f6da-45ea-872f-f6095682d30c&amp;utm_content=go_1706784233_63430302461_331635215739_aud-459688892115:pla-293946777986_c__729737939&amp;utm_custom2=1706784233&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Mb3BRCaARIsAPSNGpVujzDpo0NDIAjnsIoPdmJOxpQC8JWXOwNMqta_3YFoReRbKGQ0pC4aAiouEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reusable utensils</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and favorite insulated </span><a href="https://www.yeti.com/en_US/drinkware" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Grab take out or show off your new cooking skills and head to a </span><a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=picnic+areas&amp;find_loc=Boston%2C+MA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">park</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near you. Boston Commons, The Wharf, or Harvard Yard are all great places to set up and enjoy a meal with friends and family. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Spread Positivity! </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently living through history that will be soon be taught in classes. Though it has not been the easiest of times, people are coming together to help each other. It can be as easy as saying “hi” from across the street. It is hard to see facial expressions through masks so vocalize your kindness. Spread positivity to your community by making signs to put in your windows so people see them walking by OR grab some chalk and draw all-around your neighborhood!   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is one thing we can all take away from this time it should be how important it is to keep each other safe and healthy. Not just physical health but also mental! So spend time with people that make you happy! Just stay six feet apart and don’t forget your mask and sunscreen!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re cuffed, throupled, or self-partnered, love is whipping through the air in Boston this Valentine’s Day. But the artisanal dinners, diamond necklaces, and imported hibiscus and lotus bouquets you’ll see on the Hallmark Channel aren’t always realistic for a student looking to stretch their dollar and feel the love in our beautiful but not-exactly-cheap city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, CollegeFest put together a list of ten things you can do to mark Valentine’s Day without breaking your wallet’s heart. Brave the cold, snuggle up, or expand your horizons as you share the love with CollegeFest, all for $20 or less!</span></p>
<div style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="" src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/appalachianviews/appalachianviews1612/appalachianviews161200349/70062037-graffiti-alley-at-central-square-in-cambridge-massachusetts-.jpg" alt="Image result for graffitri alley central square" width="629" height="419" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Graffiti Alley Central Square (Jon Bilous)</p></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/">Boston Public Library:</a> Book/coffee date</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston Public Library’s historic and intimate reading rooms are a perfect place to grab a book, do some reading, and sip some coffee. Thinking of the generations of Bostonian lovers who’ve sat in the same spot is known to get the historically-minded feeling romantic&#8211;whatever does happen, make sure you maintain library noise levels. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.brattlefilm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brattle Theater </a>: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a frigid day like today, you can put yourself in the shoes of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet sharing a picture-perfect moment on a frozen pond by attending the Brattle Theatre’s 10pm screening of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Named the 6th best film of the 21st century by BBC in 2016, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was nominated for two Oscars in 2004. Disclaimer: CollegeFest is not liable for any spontaneous post-watch hair dyeing incidents.</span></p>

<p><strong>Used Bookstores: <a href="http://www.commonwealthbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commonwealth Books</a>, <a href="https://www.rodneysbookstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rodney’s</a>, <a href="http://ravencambridge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raven Books</a>, <a href="https://www.brooklinebooksmith.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brookline Booksmith,</a> <a href="https://www.rarebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston Book Company</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diving into Boston’s rich world of rare and antique books is a great way to jump-start a cozy night in. Discover a lost treasure, learn something new about your partner (or yourself!), and gather all the ingredients for a toasty evening by the fire. Or huddled next to your dorm’s heating vent.</span></p>
<div style="width: 666px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-rqq4IJG3deaUEWewGQ7xg/o.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="437" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Raven Used Books (Schiller D.Yelp)</p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s heard of the free days at the MFA and the Museum of Science, but at CollegeFest, we like ‘free’ to mean free all the time. Learning about Boston’s Revolutionary heritage, discovering what makes Boston flow at the Waterworks Museum, or delving into some wonderfully weird anatomical history at the Ether Dome won’t cost you one red cent. This year, love yourself and increase your brain power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.mbta.com/schedules/ferry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferry Ride from Long Wharf</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scenic ferry ride around the environs of Boston Harbor will make for a uniquely instagrammable Valentine’s Day this year. Catch a perfect glimpse of the city skyline by night, or go to the bow and fly like Kate and Leo in Titanic. We can provide reasonable assurance that your night will end better than theirs did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/silva-map-fall-2010-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arnold Arboretum</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Face it, you willingly moved to Boston, so you can deal with cold weather. Snuggle together for a romantic nature walk, breathe in some crisp February air, and penguin together for warmth if needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.compass.com/neighborhood-guides/boston/beacon-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beacon Hil</a>l/<a href="https://www.archdaily.com/114206/architecture-city-guide-boston" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge</a>/<a href="https://www.timeout.com/boston/back-bay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back Bay</a> Neighborhood Tours</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston’s winters may be chilly, but its neighborhoods only get more beautiful as the temperature drops. Check out these guides to plan scenic walks around the area’s best-preserved historic districts. It’s never too early to start house hunting for when you move in together! CollegeFest only recommends bringing that up if you’ve already discussed it.</span></p>
<div style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="" src="https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/acorn-st-beacon-hill.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="463" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Beacon Hill (Sarah Nichols)</p></div>
<p><strong>Hatch Shell Art Deco Performance</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the Charles River Esplanade your oyster. The historic Hatch Shell may be ‘closed’ for the season, but it’s always open to the creative energy of love. Quote Shakespearean sonnets to each other, start your own death metal band, or form stand-up comedy’s most uproarious new duo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>World’s Fair Brookline<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-dutch-house-brookline-massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Dutch House</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you miss the good old days? Vaudeville? World’s Fairs? Relive the turn of the 20th century at Brookline’s Dutch House, constructed for the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. You can’t go inside anymore, but it’s a lot cheaper than a romantic weekend in Amsterdam. Heart-shaped waffles not included.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.wheretraveler.com/boston/play/graffiti-alley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graffiti Alley </a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Cambridge’s Central Square, all you need to make your relationship tag-official is a can of paint. You can discover some of Boston’s hottest street artists, and add your own spin to this community art space. Watch out for the paint fumes.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking for activities to do in Boston this summer? Get out of your routine and explore the city. Here are a few ideas below to help get you started on your planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://paddleboston.com/about/about-paddle-boston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rent Canoes</a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit Paddle Boston to rent a canoe, kayak or paddle board to spend the afternoon exploring the Boston scenery and beautiful weather this summer. Avoid the busy lines and crowds of tourists as you paddle down the Charles River. You will paddle past many colleges in Boston, the Esplanade, Prudential Building, and so on. Explore the city from the water while experiencing the city rush. Step back and relax on your own time frame on the river. This is a great group activity to do with friends, family and even your dog! If you are interested in purchasing a season pass, the student rate for all the rentals is only $119.00 compared to the regular rate of $219.00. There are a lot of opportunities for students to have fun in Boston and you save some money when doing so.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1771" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1771" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1771 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle.png" alt="" width="1024" height="548" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle.png 1024w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle-300x161.png 300w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle-768x411.png 768w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/paddle-750x400.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1771" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Paddle Boston</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.thefreedomtrail.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Walk the Freedom Trail</strong> </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Freedom Trail is one of the largest attractions of all the historic landmarks in Boston. Being local, we tend to forget that people come from far and wide to walk this trail and take photographs of all the famous sites along the trail. You can walk along the trail with a map or join a tour group from Boston Common all the way to the Bunker Hill Monument. This trail will bring you back to your Elementary history lesson and to be thankful for this historic landmark being so accessible to us all.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_1786" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1786" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1786 size-large" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Freedom-Trail-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1786" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Boston by Foot</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.neaq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Visit the New England Aquarium</strong></a></p>
<p>Experience the world under water of Boston Harbor at the New England Aquarium. With over 70 exhibits, there is always the chance to meet the animals and watch them in action. Visiting the aquarium is a great experience whether you have a passion for animals or you want to grow a deeper connection and understanding about a particular species. With a college student I.D there is a discount off one full-priced admission ticket. Check with your student activities department at your school to find out if your school offers additional discounts for their students.</p>
<div id="attachment_1775" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1775" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1775 size-full" src="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NEAquarium.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="430" srcset="https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NEAquarium.jpg 680w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NEAquarium-300x190.jpg 300w, https://collegefest.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NEAquarium-94x60.jpg 94w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1775" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Duro Terra</p></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bostonducktours.com/Tickets/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrYmC9ZWF4wIVhiaGCh2AXAsQEAAYAyAAEgJhyfD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duck Tours</a> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing more authentic and classic to do in Boston than a Duck tour. Ride in the renovated World War II vehicle to visit a couple of the historical landmarks and then end your tour in the water for a ride along the Charles River. Throughout the ride there is narration led by the conductor. You&#8217;ll learn about all about Boston, ranging from the historical importance of Faneuil Hall to the height of the Prudential Tower and everything in between. Tickets are sold in advance for this great group activity. This is an exciting and memorable experience like no other.</span></p>

<p><strong>St.Peter&#8217;s Fiesta:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Fiesta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Peter’s Fiesta</a>, is a celebration of the city’s commercial fishing and faith, that has grown to become a city-wide party in Gloucester, MA. The events features parades, seine boat races, the blessing of the city’s commercial fishing fleet, a mid-way and the famous greasy pole contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Greasy Pole is an annual event in Gloucester MA that takes place at the Pavilion beach. This fishing port attracts the biggest crowd of the summer to watch walkers attempt to cross the greasy pole. The 40 foot wooden pole extends from a platform off Pavilion beach. The walkers end goal is the cross the pole without falling to get the red flag at the end of the pole. Winners, in addition to an inflated ego, gets carried through town, free drinks around Gloucester and fame to last a lifetime!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may ask what makes the pole so greasy? Good ole Crisco from bacon fat, fish guts and other fats local restaurants find to make the pole a greasy, slippery and challenging walk.</span></p>
<p>In general Fiesta is the biggest party weekend in Gloucester. It&#8217;s also easily accessible for summer students in Boston via the Rockport Commuter rail line, out of North Station.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested in watching this entertaining, free, and hilarious event? Head out to St. Peter’s Fiesta in Gloucester, MA on the weekend of June 28th.</span></p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.crossfitsouthie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CrossFitSouthie</a>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> located on 385 Dorchester Ave is a high intensity workout involving compound movements through body-weight, weights, and conditioning that is a great workout for anyone. CrossFit has a reputation of being costly, however this location provides students with a 10% discount rate. CrossFit is focused on core strength and conditioning and improves your cardiovascular endurance, strength, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, accuracy and builds confidence from the inside out. CrossFit stands out compared to a typical fitness facility as they incorporate gymnastics, kettlebells and various forms of weight lifting that will work exclusively with compound movements and shorter high intensity cardio sessions which develops a well-rounded strong athlete. What better way to blow off some steam, and meet new people than getting stronger and lifting at CrossFitSouthie!
